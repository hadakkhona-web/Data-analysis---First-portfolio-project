# Data-analysis - First-portfolio-project
### This is the first data analysis project that I'm publishing in Github

> ### In this project, I've analyzed data about bike sharing rentals in Washington, U.S.A between 2011 and 2012 using the programming language R to process, clean and analyze data, then I've used the cleaned data to make a Dashborad in Tableau ploatform.
### The goal is to cover insight about the impact of many factors on bikes are used over the year

Here are the links to the interactive visualization in Tableau:

[Dashborad 1:](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikesharingrentalsWashingtonD_C_USA/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

[Dashboard 2:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bikesharingrentalsclimaticfactors/Bikesharingrentalspart2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

#### *Note that the first sheet in Dashboard 2 doesn't show up in the image file but it's fine if you reached the interactive version*
