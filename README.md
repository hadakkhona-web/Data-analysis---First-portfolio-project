# Data-analysis---First-portfolio-project
This is the first data analysis project that I'm publishing in Github

> In this project, I've analyzed data about bike sharing rentals in Washington, U.S.A between 2011 and 2012 using the programming language R to process, clean and analyze data, then I've used the cleaned data to make a Dashborad in Tableau ploatform.
### The goal is to cover insight about the impact of many factors on bikes are used over the year
